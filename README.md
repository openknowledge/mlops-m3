# mlops-m3
An MLOps Plattform for a local k8s minikube setup to demo a Machine Learning Application and how to keep a model in production.

## Local k8s platform

You can use k3s or minikube if you are on linux or macos if you are familiar with it.
For Windows we recommend to use KinD (Kubernetes in Docker).

## Setting up your local kind cluster for this Workshop

We are using a two staged terraform stack to apply all the infrastructure and services that we need.
First Stage is to create a cluster and some infrastructure parts.
Second Stage will apply platform services that allow observability and CICD.

### Adding routes to /etc/hosts
The Cluster will expose some ingresses.
Add some routes like this to your /etc/hosts so that you don't have to bother with port-forwards.

```
    127.0.0.1       prometheus.localhost
    127.0.0.1       grafana.localhost
    127.0.0.1       gitea.localhost
    127.0.0.1       evidently.localhost
```

### HINT!

Currently the Terraform Execution expects an evidently to exist in the local docker registry.
So please make sure to create it before executing the following commands.
!TODO This will be resolved as soon as we have the ML Application in this Repo.

You don't need to load the image to kind on your own - Terraform is doing it for you!

### Creating a Cluster and its Infrastructure

To create the Kind cluster and some infrastructure parts we are using Terraform.

```
    > cd src/main/terraform/cluster-infrastructure
    cluster-infrastructure > terraform init
    cluster-infrastructure > terraform apply
```

### Installing the platform with terraform

Now we can apply the rest of the stack with terraform on to our created kind cluster.

``` 
    > cd ../platform
    platform > terraform init
    platform > terraform apply
```

###

As long as the evidently image is not built automatically by terraform execute this.
- Assuming the image is locally present and called evidently with latest tag
```
    kind load docker-image evidently
```
